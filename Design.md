# Distributed Array Sum Design

## Summary
- Distributed array summation system
- Multiple nodes have differente languages and OSs (may be physical or virtual)
- One coordinator nodes (which may be reelected) delegates sub-parts of array summation to the other nodes
- Communication is done through **gRPC**
- Capable of handling node or coordinator failures, with proper recovery.

## Assumptions
- The array of N integers is initially available at the coordinator node.
- The system will consist of multiple nodes (physical computers, VMs, or containers).
- Each node will have a gRPC server running to handle incoming messages.
- Communication between nodes will be done over gRPC (based on HTTP/2 protocol).
- Each member must implement using different operating systems and different programming languages (both supporting gRPC).
- In case of a coordinator node failure, a leader election process will trigger over gRPC.
- Nodes must recover gracefully from temporary network issues or process crashes.

## Architecture
- Coordinator node:
    - Splits the array into chunks.
    - Calls worker nodesâ€™ gRPC services to send chunks.
    - Collects partial sums via gRPC responses.
    - Computes and displays final sum.
    - Detects failures through gRPC connection errors.
- Worker Nodes:
    - Expose gRPC service endpoints to:
        - Receive array chunks.
        - Compute and return partial sums.
    - Participate in leader election (if needed) through gRPC communication.
